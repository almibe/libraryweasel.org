= Setting up a development environment
Like all software Library Weasel has a few dependencies that you need to have installed
on your development machine before you can work with it.

== JDK

== Intellj Community Edition

== Gradle

== npm

== Gradle properties
To use the `copyPlugin` gradle task Library Weasel expects there to be a gradle
property named `libraryWeaselInstance` to be set.
See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html[docs]
for details on setting gradle properties in general.  On linux machines the
easiest way to do this is to create a `.gradle` directory in your home directory
that contains a file called `gradle.properties` below is an example of how this
variable would be set in this file.

```
libraryWeaselInstance=/home/alex/IdeaProjects/library-weasel/build/library-weasel
```
