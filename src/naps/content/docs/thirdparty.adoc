= Third Party Dependencies

Library Weasel, like much free software, builds on top of already existing tools and libraries.
This page lists out and describes some of the most important of these projects.  Many other projects
are used but below are the ones that almost every Library Weasel plugin are likely to use.

== Apache Felix/Dependency Manager
Apache Felix is an implementation of the OSGi standard.  The core of Library Weasel uses OSGi to load
and manage all plugins.  Dependency Manager is an Apache Felix subproject that helps developers work
with dynamic services and their dependencies.  Instead of directly using Dependency Manager which provides
a Java api to work with Library Weasel uses a set of annotations to mark services and dependencies.  These
annotations are found in the library-weasel-servo project.

== Vert.x-Web
Vert.x-Web is a project build on Vert.x that is similar to Sinatra, Ratpack, and other micro web frameworks.
Vert.x-Web was chosen over other similar projects because it runs on the JVM, is easy to embed, plays well with
OSGi, is well documented, built to be polyglot, and is actively developed.

== Xodus Entity Store
Xodus Entity Store is an embedded database that allows storing schemaless entities with attributes and
links to other entities fitting somewhere between a key value store and a full blown graph database.
It is quick to start up and is easy to embed into an application.

== Gradle
Gradle is a build tool for the JVM.  I find it easier to work with and extend than other tools such as
maven or ant.  Several projects related to Library Weasel are simply plugins for Gradle.

== Kotlin
Kotlin is an alternative statically typed JVM language that focuses on clean and maintainable code.
Since it comes from JetBrains it also focuses on being toolable and is well supported by the community
edition of IntelliJ IDEA.
https://kotlinlang.org/

== Groovy
Groovy is a scripting language for the JVM that is easy to embed into applications.  It is mainly used
by the library-weasel-developer-script plugin to allow users to run scripts within a Library Weasel
instance.

== KotlinTest/Spock
KotlinTest and Spock are two specification testing frameworks for the JVM.

== Hyperapp
Hyperapp is a frontend javascript library that focuses on making it easier to create reactive and
maintainable UIs.

== Bulma
Bulma is a CSS framework similar to Bootstrap and Foundation however Bulma separates itself from some
other frameworks by having no javascript dependencies.

== Parcel
Parcel is a front end application bundler.  There are many projects that do similar work and all are
options for using with Library Weasel.  I've choosen Parcel since it requires little configuration
and currently builds much faster from within a Gradle build than webpack.
