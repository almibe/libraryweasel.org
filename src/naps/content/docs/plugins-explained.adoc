= Plugins Explained
Library Weasel was designed with a modular plugin system at its core that allows users to create
extensions on both the server and frontend.  Because of this it can be a little daunting at first
to manage so many small projects instead of a single monolithic one, but this is what makes it relevant
to compare Library Weasel to a breadboard.  This page exists to explain each of the core application,
server, and developer plugins and projects.
