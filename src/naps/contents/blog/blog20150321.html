      <p>The development version of Library Weasel is now up on github at <a href="http://www.github.com/almibe/library-weasel">github.com/almibe/library-weasel</a>.
      This early version is still being worked on and can be considered to be a proof of concept for the project.  So far this version implements the key features of
      the UI with a simple two pane display and a context sensitive toolbar on top for performing actions.  One pane is for displaying resources and the other is for dashes.
      Below are two screen shots of this UI.</p>
      <div class="row">
	      <div class="large-6 columns text-center screenShot">
	        <a href="img/ss1.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="img/sss1.png" /></a>
	      </div>
	      <div class="large-6 columns text-center screenShot">
	        <a href="img/ss2.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="img/sss2.png" /></a>
	      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Dashes are small single purpose application panels that are supplied to Library Weasel via plugins to work with resources.  These are shown in a tab pane similar
      to modern IDEs and web browsers.  Resources can represent anything a plugin creator wants to keep track of.  Example resources could include a file on disk, a URL,
      or a reference into a database.</p>
      <p>Currently supported resources in the github project are <a href="http://www.groovy-lang.org">Groovy</a> script files and
      <a href="http://www.orientechnologies.com/">OrientDB</a> SQL files.  These resources are made to be used with two included plugins.  One is for running scripts
      from within the context of Library Weasel for scripting the application, and the other is for running queries and commands against an embedded OrientDB instance
      that comes included with Library Weasel.  These two plugins create a foundation on which other plugins can be built.</p>
      <p>As I document this application and create new plugins I'll be updating
      this website.  For now the application can be found on github with instructions for building although I'll be posting a built release soon for download.</p>
