      <p>I wanted to post an update since this site has been pretty quiet.  There has been some very significant changes since I first put Library Weasel up on github several months ago.  The most important change is that Library Weasel is no long just a desktop application.  Instead it is now a bit of a hybrid desktop/local web application.  When the application starts up an admin panel pops up that allows users to control the application and has a link to open the web portion of the application in your default browser or copy the URL to your clip board.</p>
      <p>The main idea is to separate things that desktop applications excel at and things that web applications excel at.  Desktop applications are good for managing application’s life cycle, working with the local file system (especially for large files), and running scripts that have full access to the system.  Meanwhile web applications are pretty good at everything else involved with user interfaces and work flow.</p>
      <p>There is still work to be done on the core application, but I've also began work on some initial plugins for working with open data sets.  I hope my next update will focus on some of these plugins especially ones pertaining to RDF and other linked data technologies.</p>
      <p>That’s it for now, hopefully updates will be coming more regularly from now on after this rewrite.  Keep in mind that Library Weasel is a fully free and open source project so suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, whatever are very welcome through Library Weasel’s github page @ <a href="https://github.com/almibe/library-weasel">github.com/almibe/library-weasel</a>!</p>
