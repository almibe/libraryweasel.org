Library Weasel has been written from day one to be helpful to developers (it's almost like a developer wrote it).
Library Weasel plugins are intended to be developed incrementally in a running instance of Library Weasel.  The way
that this is handled is by allow plugins to be dynamically loaded by default instead of a requiring workarounds like
some other software.  In fact the library-weasel-gradle-plugin project contains a task that supports this, the
`copyPlugin` task.  This task as you may well guess copies a newly built plugin into the plugin directory of an
instance of Library Weasel.  Because of the flexibility of gradle there are multiple ways to configure what directory
to copy the plugin into although one is reccomended and another is suggested in certain cases.

The recommended approach is to just globally define the location of the instance of Library Weasel you are working with
in the file ~/.gradle/gradle.properties like this

`libraryWeaselInstance=/path/to/instance/`
or
`libraryWeaselInstance=C:\path\to\instance\`

However if you only need to support copying a plugin to a specific instance that you normally aren't concerned about
you can place this line in the projects own gradle.properties (you probably won't want to commit that change though).
